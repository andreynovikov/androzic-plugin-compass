<b>This is an Androzic plugin.</b> It provides magnetic compass screen. It can be run as a standalone application. If used as a plugin it requires Androzic version 1.7 or higher. Launcher icon can be disabled.

The compass uses magnetic sensor of your device and works correctly both in portrait and landscape mode, optionally locked to portrait mode.

To get the most accurate readings from the compass be sure to keep it in a horizontal level. The compass is most accurate when close to earth.

The compass fully depends on the performance of your device. If it is inaccurate, please check that you aren't being affected by a magnetic field (large metal objects, magnets, high voltage devices). Also you should calibrate your device before each use of compass.
